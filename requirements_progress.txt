Lab Requirements

Git Commit Workflow:
[X] Create a Git repository for your project 
[*] commit your changes frequently.
[ ] You are required to have at least five commits that reflect meaningful progress. EG:
    [*] setting up HTML structure
    [ ] adding each specific event handler
    [ ] applying CSS styling
    [X] add requirements_progress.txt

[*] Each commit message should clearly describe the change
    [ ] Implemented mouse event for hover effect


[X] Note: Projects with fewer than five commits will automatically receive a grade of zero.
    This is to emphasize the importance of maintaining a detailed commit history, 
    which is essential in real-world development.


[X] Deployment on GitHub Pages:
[X] Push your project to a GitHub repository.
[X] Deploy the project using GitHub Pages.
[ ] You should provide a live link to your deployed page.
[ ] Verify that the deployed version functions as intended, with all event types working smoothly.


HTML Structure:
[X] Create a webpage with sections for various types of events.
    Your HTML file should include the following:

    [X] A button to demonstrate mouse events EG:
        [X] hovering shows start message
        [X] exiting hover / leaving the button should change a message
    
    [X] An input field to capture keyboard events EG:
        [X] display the latest key down pressed
        [X] display the latest key up released
    
    [X] A simple form to handle form events. EG:
       [X] display a message when the form is submitted without refreshing the page

    [ ] An input field to handle focus and blur events EG:
        [ ] update a message when the input gains or loses focus.

    [ ] A container with multiple buttons to demonstrate event delegation EG 
       [ ] clicking any button inside the container displays its label or content


CSS Styling:
[*] Add minimal styling to visually separate each section.
    Your styling doesnâ€™t need to be complex, 
    but it should make it easy to see where each interactive element is.


JavaScript Event Handling:
In your JavaScript file, write code to handle each of the specific events listed:

[X] Mouse Events: 
    [X] Detect when a button is hovered over and when the hover ends. 
    [X] Display messages for each state.

[X] Keyboard Events: 
    [X] Capture input from a text field, displaying the last key pressed.

[X] Form Events: 
    [X] Handle form submission, preventing the default behavior and
    [X] displaying a submission message.

[ ] Focus Events: 
    [ ] Update a message when an input field 
    [ ] gains focus or
    [ ]  loses focus.

[ ] Event Delegation: 
    [ ] Use a container element with several buttons. 
    [ ] Use event delegation to handle clicks on any button in the container
    [ ] and display a unique message for each.


Submission 

[ ] GitHub Repository Link: Submit the link to your GitHub repository.
[ ] GitHub Pages Link: Provide the live URL of your deployed project.
[ ] Commit Requirement: Ensure your repository has at least five meaningful commits.
